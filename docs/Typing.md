Typing
======
This is a program designed to efficiently optimize keyboard layouts, inspired by the work done by Peter Klausler.
It uses a (relatively) friendly command-line interface to allow the user to customize a keyboard layout.

I began developing this program in 2008 and have been working on it since then. For updates, see

  - What English keyboard? Qwerty?, Dvorak?, Colemak, ...
  - Same location of letters in both keyboard
    * Is it a good idea ?
    * What about 'cross scripting' font glyph issues
  - But then harder for adoption
